                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buying more utility aiming for 2 pieces of utility thrown per round played avg, so on a full buy you can use 4 pieces of util and on a full-save, you use none so it balances.</li>
                    <li>Using the utility you do buy, so for the rounds you do buy utility you tend to keep it too long and sometimes don’t end of using most of it, so using a mixture of preemptive(Before you see the enemies) and reactive(After you see the enemies) utility will make the best use of this util.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of the number of bullets left in your magazine as you are often running out of bullets mid-gun-fight and having to switch to your secondary.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol sometimes shooting before your crosshair is on the enemy's head.</li>
                    <li>Crosshair placement on the enemy is a bit low when they are far away leading to a lot of body shooting at a distance which got you killed as the enemy was able to turn around and headshot you.</li>
                    <li>Spraying close to medium range seems to be quite strong.</li>
                </ul>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, small movement mistake getting caught on the wall, taking long-range fight on the enemy market, really nice shot on the enemy catwalk, good reaction to the calls of the enemy in apps. W</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, an interesting choice not to buy any utility while still having over $2k in the bank, good upgrade to a teammate AK, but unfortunately, you got pushed by an enemy-pushing palace which completely caught you off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again no utility while still having 1700 and it being a full buy, hiding top middle while not peeking to support your teammates from the enemy catwalk or getting the trade, nice kill on the enemy bottom middle, unfortunately, fight on the enemy window running out of bullets mid-fight, but you managed to get away and repeek landing a very nice headshot on the enemy catwalk, good job falling back and taking a different position although your teammates changed your mind and made you to back towards A from apps and this led to you having to rush to the site in order to try to plant. L</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, good job picking up the weapon of a dead teammate and securing a kill on the enemy triple, unfortunate timing on the enemy peeking you getting the kill. L</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, no armour, good usage of sound to dodge a nade they dropped apps, and solid job picking up the AK from the enemy catwalk, although you were exposing yourself to market window and still looking catwalk while you saw your teammate coming up catwalk, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, small smoke fail when attempting to smoke middle window, good rotation back towards A, nice attempt at mollying Jungle but unfortunately, the enemy flanked your teammate Jungle who ended up catching you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, getting timinged on the Peeks catwalk, really nice adjustment on the enemy market securing that kill although the jump out of the window while on low HP and the catwalk player was still there allowed him to kill you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, thought about flashing to assist your teammates getting out ramp but decided against it, solid smoke towards jungle but this would have been better used towards CT. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 buy,  good job boosting your teammate in window, Unfortunately, the first boost failed, alerting the enemies in Jungle of your intentions, good usage of sound to effectively dodge utility-like flashes from middle, the body shots were not idea although fortunately the enemy was relatively low which allowed you to get the kill, good job picking up the enemies weapon and securing a second kill catwalk although unfortunately the second enemy catwalk caught you as you peeked him.</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, peeking and holding apps although the distance is outside of the optimal range, and the m4 peeking you had a huge advantage in this fight. L</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, nice attempt at trading your buddy in palace but because you stopped prefiring this allowed the enemy to recognise your location and then get the kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, not buying any utility even while having $1900, good job being weary of a possible flank from T apps, good reposition in middle to aim for a headshot angle but unfortunately the enemy landed a grenade right on your head doing 50 damage but you managed to secure the kill after he missed an AWP shot. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good trade on the enemy jumping into lowers who killed your teammate, solid second kill on the other one who jumped and almost the third but unfortunately your last spray you ran out of ammo and this got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, again not buying any utility even while having $4000 in the bank, solid kill on the enemy running upstairs from lowers, good job planting the bomb, really nice shot on the enemy jungle and good adjustment on the enemy peeking close triple, nearly clutching the 1v3 situation almost getting the headshot on the last enemy. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping the awp for a teammate after they requested it, decent flash over ramp although the lamp flash would have been a better one to throw, dangerous positioning while holding CT almost getting you caught 2-3 times but you managed to hit a very nice quick scope to secure the kill on CT but a little overly confidence in your knowledge of the enemies position caused you to overlook Stairs. L</li>
                    <li>P2k armour, nice positioning triple which is good usage of distance and isolation, unfortunately, the enemy managed to hit a few body shots on you and a headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven armour, nice dink the enemy ramp, although you weapon switched after getting the headshot so it wasn’t a good idea, nice second peek securing a nice kill. L</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, small bit of util damage take 25, unfortunate timing on the rotation to B with your knife out getting you in trouble with an enemy which pushing into window. L</li>
                    <li>UMP buy, solid damage on the enemy towards van although unfortunate positioning. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly ramp and good reaction to the calls B and nice rotation into Markte allowing you to secure a quick kill in Markte and follow it up with the enemy next to him. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, taking a bit of unnecessary damage but accidentally missing the smoke to put of the middle molly thrown by the enemies, small movement mistake going through death hole, unfortunate timing on the peek against the enemy on site. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at using the stairs angle into the ramp Unfortunately the enemy managed to land a double headshot on you top stairs. L</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, while still having 2300 and not buying any utility a bit of a weird buy especially not buying any rifle, solid kill on the one enemy triple who didn’t realize your positioning. W</li>
                    <li>Awp buy, small mistakes not getting the awp dropped to you early round, also dropping all your utility and not having a pistol is not a good thing when playing awp, overflick with the awp missing the shot on the enemy catwalk. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, not buying utility, spraying in-between to enemies doing equal damage but managing to secure the one by switching to the p2k. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no utility, really nice kill on the enemy palace and nice off-angle on the ladder securing a second and then a third all from palace, fantastic round. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice molly into ramp, nice coms, solid kill on the enemy on site, good damage. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>I guess I was comfortable in the position I was in.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played?<br>Honestly not really happy with those positions, all of that positioning was kind of do or die, and the transitioning between different spots was difficult.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel?<br>I guess in a way it was sometimes on the enemy. I believe that play on apartments when I fought two catwalk they knew where I was. </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game?<br>I feel like generally I only needed one big adjustment, spray control felt pretty good, I can’t say it was perfect but it was pretty good. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side?<br>I guess in a sense it was very average and I think I did switch it up a bit when peeking middle and playing a bit of a waiting game.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel?<br>Anytime I rotated, I felt like I was getting pressured so that decision-making factor was thrown out the window and it didn’t feel very consistent. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>I felt like my utility was absolutely useless and especially not knowing how to use utility properly and having that knowledge on how to use flash grenades of smoke.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information in a timely manner?<br>Sometimes and I think I fumbled up a little bit on communication, I don’t really remember specific locations on maps. </li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Map knowledge for sure and utility usage and especially communication. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?<br>I honestly got along with them pretty well, although the way we could have done it probably could have been a bit better, but they were quite inconsistent in terms of their aim</li>

            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When going for shots try to make sure your crosshair is as close to the enemies head as possible instead of shooting first and adjusting later.</li>
                    <li>Try to always position yourself within the optimal range of the weapon you are playing with close range with SMG/Pistol/Shotgun and far with scout and awp.</li>
                    <li>Always be weary of the number of bullets you have left in your mag as running out of bullets mid-fight can be a very frustrating way to die.</li>
                    <li>Whenever the bomb is planted you want to execute the retake as quickly as possible because the longer the bomb is planted the more pressure it puts on you to do the retake rushed.</li>
                    <li>Double-clearing angles wastes time and energy during this game you double-cleared a few angles causing your crosshair to stay on a safe angle for longer than necessary and required you to do more input.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tapping is quite good but often missing the first shot, due to not lining it up properly and adjusting off of pure reactions after that.</li>
                    <li>When headshot only mode for pistols got turned off you started focusing a lot more on bodyshots which wasn’t the right direction, when on pistol rounds headshots reign supreme so you want to make sure you focus on getting them.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice positioning triple into Ramp, solid swap onto holding short Unfortunately you shot before your crosshair was on the enemies head causing you to miss, nice kill on the enemy close market although bodyshotting wasn’t ideal, running out of ammo mid right wasn’t ideal as it put you in great danger good job peeking again after reloading and securing second kill but couldn’t get the third. L</li>
                    <li>Fiven seven buy, good job choosing the most likely site for them to take but your positioning wasn’t great, whenever you play with the Five seven there is an optimal range at which it is most effective at killing enemies I deem this throwing range, both of the main fights you took were significantly outside this range, also you didn’t position yourself somewhere where you could take advantage of your positional advantage and instead gave that up immediately. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice positioning under palace belcony but you stayed too long and ran out of ammo mid-fight, this caused you to be stuck with a default pistol facing enemies pushing out ramp which got you killed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job repositioning to make up for teammates’ decision to take your position (this wouldn’t usually happen with teammates you choose) solid peek into apps from site although your crosshair placement and focus were off which caused you to whiff this spray a bit and get you killed. L</li>
                    <li>mp9 buy, nice molly into Apps. However, your rotation through middle wasn’t a good path as it was dangerous as there were a bunch of long range engagements, nice attempt at flashing A site for the retake but the 2v3 retake was difficult. The fact the bomb was down for so long meant you should have saved sooner but unfortunately you spent so long looking for the enemy that the bomb ended up killing you. L</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, nice positioning under belcony, good rotation to the jungle, but your team cleaned up, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Mp9 buy, solid rotation off of B once it was confirmed you have control of the bomb, although nearly caught from connector which was dangerous Fortunately your teammate triple had the angle and killed the enemy connector, weird smoke top ramp, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, teammates again stay A forcing you to go B, good molly into apps to support your awper on van getting 2, nice job holding catwalk, weird smoke catwalk somehow landing on the roofing, no action. W</li>
                    <li>T side Pistol armour, B rush, clearing multiple angles that don’t have enemies multiple times, good kill on the enemy catwalk with a solid headshot. W</li>
                    <li>Mac-10, interesting short smoke and weird top middle flash, really nice kill on the enemy flanking top middle, nice peek into connector to trade your teammate, and a solid clutch killing the last enemy jungle with a good spray, very nice triple. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, opting to not throw the top middle flash, nice B flash but I would have recommended helping your B players with more support utility onto B, like the window Market window smoke and the Bench molly, nice job recognising the enemies flanking but poor timing to pull out and throw some LOS utility allowing the enemy to peek you while you had utility out. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement out ramp although you trying to throw utility you can’t quite remember and getting it slightly off, I will reshow you the CT smoke from ramp and tetris, really nice kill on the enemy triple, and crossing in front of jungle without clearing it or using utility to safely cross assuming it was safe because your teammate was stairs, unfortunately ending up in a collat. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nothing to much to talk about. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, taking mid-control, nice attempt at flashing middle, panicked in middle when dropping utility accidentally exposing yourself to multiple opponents</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>It's quite hot.</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played?<br>I wasn’t really comfortable on B in terms of holding down the site and there wasn’t really any communication in terms of who was going where. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel?<br>Sometimes felt like the crosshair placement was directly on the enemy.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game?<br>It felt good enough, I honestly think I could have done a little better with the spray control.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side?<br>I did peeks that felt natural.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel?<br>I feel like I did a few mistakes here and there when it came to the movement aspect. I feel like the peek on the enemy through market window asn’t executed precisely, I felt like movement just wasn’t right. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>I may have flashed one of them and of course, trying to flash the window in the middle, accidentally made a mistake there once, but besides that, I feel like the smoke could have been done better, I have messed up quite a few times in terms of the smokes, </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information in a timely manner?<br>I did give a few callouts in terms of communication, stumbling especially during first round CT when I spotted the enemy catwalk but accidentally said connector, there were a few occasions where I got killed and gave basic callouts.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Positioning, I don’t really play on window, other than if I am given an Awp, and having an idea of where to position myself with specific weapons.</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?<br>Not really only on a rainy day.</li>

                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not clearing Angle properly, this lead to you sometimes being caught in unexpected positions by an enemy, also pulling out your knife for the bonus speed is an alright idea but not when there is any chance of an enemy peeking you.</li>
                    <li>Lots of LOS utility which temporarily exposes you to the enemies peeks, I always recommend keep this to a minimum.</li>
                    <li>Always make sure you are reloading behind good cover and away from enemies to prevent them from hearing your reloading which might prompt aggression.</li>

                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Nuke</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice short on the enemy's you come out the door dinking one and then securing the kill on the one outside mouth, unfortunately not clearing the top hut angle as you came out onto side allowing you to get caught off-guard and killed. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, running and dropping some LOS utility out hut without properly clearing it with a gun was quite dangerous and then good job entry onto site, unfortunate spray control nearly killing the enemy heaven unfortunately he had the weaponry advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Mac-10 buy, good job crossing angles although your choice of positions to run with your knife out is a little dangerous, good job switching to the AK and good job getting the trade kill on the enemy flying down from heaven and good adjustment to look at the enemy running out of hut and killing him before he could kill your teammate. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Playing back A main solo is a good play as if you are trying to solo hold A main there are 3 potential positions you are available to be shot from, good job catching the enemy pushing from ramp off guard, although pushing out hut you didn’t check above you which got you killed also not having body-armour meant you got killed with a usp headshot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice quick rotate from outside to lowers to help your teammates, although your peeking and movement on B site was a little dangerous, good attempt at trying to prefire the door angle but unfortunately it was a little high and left which is when the enemy actually opened the door you had to do a significant adjustment and this led to you running out of ammo. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, Good job covering hut and nice adjustment to kill the enemy pushing squeaky, and solid trade kill on the enemy door, good flash peek onto the enemy by heaven completely blinding him and nice prefire dink and followup molly on the last enemy heaven as well as sitting at a solid angle to hold for his peek Mouth and overall good quad. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Bad LOS utility ramp as you ran around the corner with a smoke pulled out instead of having your gun if someone was behind the molly you would have died, nice spray control after pushing through the smoke with the flash to secure the final kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting underhand flash to peek stairs from lowers, good job helping your teammate get the kill on the enemy vents, nice reposition to behind red container and solid damage on the last coming out of control room. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting outside flash bouncing it off the light poll, nice attempt at adjusting to the enemy outside but unfortunately your spray control wasn’t correctly executed. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job dropping for your teammate, but the process can be made slightly more efficient with ctrl buying weapons, good kill on the enemy pushing hut, solid crosshair placement, and nice job properly clearing top hut after being punished previously, I do not recommend trying to switch between two angle like hut and heaven, just focus on the one and allow your teammate to cover the other. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice awareness of the potential door push and being ready for it, and good kill on the enemy pushing door although caught off-guard by the second peek from the enemy mouth. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job supporting your teammates, and really good job playing passive on A main completely catching the enemy pushing door off-guard, really nice shot on the enemy door, and good rotation to help your teammates take outside, nice tap on the enemy just under heaven, securing the second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, unforutnate set of events with the peek door, and reloading as you peeked back into lobby unfortunately getting caught off-guard by the enemy pushing with a shotgun. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice entry onto A from mouth, small whiff when trying to kill the enemy on the ladder but good job not over-committing to the fight. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice patience killing the enemies who pushed lobby and waiting for them to go up the ladder and catch them as they are trying to get onto silo and good awareness and patience to not push or peek to agro. W</li>
                    <li>CT Pistol armour, small movement mistake on the ladder, good job killing the first but the body spam could have gotten you in trouble, you run away with your knife out nearly got you punished twice this round, so be weary of how quickly you can be peekde, good job killing the enemy heaven. W</li>
                    <li>MP9 buy, good job picking the mp9 instead of a full buy, as getting these eco kills with an mp9 is usually easier and it gives you a lot more money for the following round in this was +1800 setting you up perfectly with a triple .W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good attempt at stopping them coming out door and nice adjustment to the enemy who dropped vents early and rotated back up through secret. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid spray control on the first out hut and good job securing the second but unfortunately, the third pushed ramp and up to heaven catching you completely off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid commitment with your teammates into A main and good awareness of the potential flank from outside via hut and door, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, really nice adjustment to the enemy secret, and good kill on the enemy single, solid triple kill on the retake, unfortunate timing on the fourth peeking single killing you but your teammate traded just couldn’t defuse in time. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good rotation down to lowers to catch the enemies pushing secret, solid spray kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid rotation down to single from A, good flash peek and kill onto the enemy close and then a really good flick onto the enemy B site behind red container. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice molly outside and good peek onto the enemy peeking single door, bad los flash peeking garage nearly getting you killed, nice peek on the enemy top mouth to secure a quick second kill, really nice flick and adjustment securing the third on. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life?<br>Pretty comfortable and sliding a little bit in the chair, and a little thirsty. </li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played?<br>CT side for sure I felt happy with the positions I was in but on T side I wasn’t particularly happy with the position I was in, however I would have preferred to do a little more lurking than entry fragging, it could have been better in terms of communication. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel?<br>Usually around corners if felt like it was on the enemy, although there were moments when the crosshair was on the enemy but I zoned out at the moment of the peek.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game?<br>It was okay, there was one moment on CT side, where I took down one enemy and again there was one moment where my spray messed up heavily but overall spray control felt pretty good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side?<br>Mostly normal peeks and crouching is something I asked a bunch of players in the past and only using it in very specific situations, I did try to do a little bit of shoulder peeking.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel?<br>Just in time and I think a couple of times I bumped into walls or on CT side jumping over the fence, movement overall felt pretty good. </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>There was a few moments where it kind of negatively impacted my teammates, and with smokes honestly, it was a very limited smoke usage on my part. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information in a timely manner?<br>yea from time to time, and there was lacklustre communication when it came to where we wanted to go and in terms of callouts I felt like it was pretty good.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Utility, and practise utility and definitely can improve my communication. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again?<br>hell yea, they were pretty cool. </li>
